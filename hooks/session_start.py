"""Restore learning context when Claude Code starts or resumes a session.

Claude Code sends a JSON event on stdin. For a project with active learning notes,
we print JSON instructions telling Claude which files to read. Otherwise we stay
silent. This hook does not teach, write notes, or parse conversation transcripts.
The events that trigger it (including compaction) are configured in hooks.json.
