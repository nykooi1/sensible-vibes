"""Restore learning context when an agent session starts or resumes.

Supported platforms:
  Claude Code – sends hook_event_name='SessionStart' with cwd.
  Codex CLI   – sends hook_event_name='SessionStart' with cwd and source
                (startup | resume | clear | compact | fork).

For a project with active learning notes, we print JSON instructions telling
the agent which files to read. Otherwise we stay silent.
This hook does not teach, write notes, or parse conversation transcripts.
The events that trigger it (including compaction) are configured in hooks.json.
