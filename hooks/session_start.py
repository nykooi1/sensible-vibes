"""Restore learning context when an AI agent session starts or resumes.

Supported platforms:
  Claude Code – sends hook_event_name='SessionStart' with cwd.
  Codex CLI   – sends hook_event_name='SessionStart' with cwd and source.
  Antigravity – sends PreInvocation event with workspacePaths and invocationNum.

For a project with active learning notes, we output instructions telling the agent
which files to read. Otherwise we exit silently.
This hook does not teach, write notes, or parse conversation transcripts.
The events that trigger it are configured in hooks.json.
